# CFL SQL course project - Art School
Final project for the May/June 2023 CFG SQL & Data course. For more info on CFG, visit [their website](https://codefirstgirls.com/).

## Assignment
The assignment was to create a relational DB with multiple tables, using primary and foreign keys to link them, and then to query the database using group bys, joins and views to analyse and present the data in a logical manner. Additionally, we should create and use stored functions and procedures.

## Concept
For this project, I decided to create a database for a fictional art school. They would need to keep track of students, teachers, classes, and payment information.
